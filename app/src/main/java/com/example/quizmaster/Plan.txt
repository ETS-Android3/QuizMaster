What I need to add the application :
- Request Handling Singleton
- Make a simple JsonObjectRequest to the server
- On the server side, handle request and add to the database
- Also implement a way to send back the JsonObject (package it from database) to the client
- Clean up code and test-driven development (maybe???)
- Edit backend to handle all different forms of text, and alert the frontend if something is wrong...
